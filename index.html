    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Teng and I am a student at Algonquin College.<br>
      I am in the Interactive Media Design program, and I will be graduating in 2019.<br>
      On this site, you will find some of the projects I have worked on.</p>

      <img src="./images/QuotePics/Happy Adam Low Key.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>Adam</h2>
      <p>This is my friend Adam. He's a cool guy. I helped him with some photography stuff. I know this isn't a quote
        but creating real content is too hard. For the off chance you actually read all the content on people's pages,
        here's a friendly reminder to stay hydrated. Have a good night (or day, I don't know when you'll get around to
        grading my assignment.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <img src="./images/QuotePics/Paulina06.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>Paulina</h2>
      <p>I could have copied and pasted my last paragraph since it's not realy content, but whats the fun in that? I
        kind of like just writing my random thoughts down. You ever really crave certain food? I could really use a
        beaver tail right about now. I'm writing this at 3am because of bad life decisions. Oh and this is Paulina. :)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <img src="./images/QuotePics/Bri02.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>Bri</h2>
      <p>I wrote this stuff super late at night because I like staying up late. I don't really procrastinate, I kind of
        just like working at night for some reason. There's something peacefull about working in the dark knowing
        you're probably the only person still awake. I could do anything at this time and nobody would be awake to
        judge me. Seriously, I could stare at a wall for 3 hours and nobody would give rats booty. Also, please don't
        take away marks because I used the term "rats booty" on a mid term.</p>
